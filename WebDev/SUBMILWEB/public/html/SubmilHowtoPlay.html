            The game's decks are made of 23 cards. 3 of them are the identity cards, 
            which are the ones in play at all times in the match, and the rest are a 
            mix of attack, defense andmiscellaneous cards (such as draw cards and 
            effect cards). Matches are intended to last around 14 turns, 7 from each 
            player.
